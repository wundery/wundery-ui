# Wundery user interface framework

Welcome! This is a CSS framework used in the Wundery store backend. We opend this project in order to enable third party developers to build apps which appear in the wundery Look and feel. You can use this repo to look around or point us on bugs.

## Usage

Embed the ui framework:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui.wundery.com/v1.5.0/ui.css" />
```

For the React people we have sweet [bindings at place](https://github.com/wundery/wundery-ui-react).

## Local development

* Run `yarn start`
